<strong> Below is a description of how a typical Simply Voting election unfolds. Keep in mind that each customer has different requirements and some solutions involve mailings, kiosks, telephone voting, or other "extras"..</strong>
<i>
<p>
Voters arrive at your branded voting website and authenticate their identity (how this works depends on the authentication method you selected in step 1). If authentication was successful, the voter will be presented with a list of any ongoing elections. If the voter hasn't yet voted, the voter may click on the election and a tamper-proof electronic ballot will appear. When the voter submits a ballot, the results are encrypted and kept anonymous. The voter is issued a receipt and is now blocked from voting for this election again.
</i>
</p>
<p>
<u>
Once voting has ended the results are immediately tabulated. You can view the results in the Election Manager along with various reports on voting activity before publishing them. Once published, the results are made available to the public on your voting website and anyone will be able to verify the results by downloading a file containing votes and receipt codes.

<b>Environmental Impact of Online Voting:-</b>
The carbon footprint is a measure of the impact an organization or event has on the environment, and in particular climate change. It relates to the amount of harmful greenhouse gases emitted through transport, land clearance, and the production and consumption of food, fuels, manufactured goods, materials, wood, roads, buildings, and services. The carbon footprint is measured in kilograms of carbon dioxide (CO2) equivalent.

According to our research, holding a paper ballot election for 10,000 voters generates greenhouse gas emissions of over 500kg of CO2. Thatâ€™s equivalent to driving over 1000 miles in an average passenger car. The environmental cost increases if you are mailing the ballot to voters.

Holding an election online is easier on the environment since there is less paper involved. If you can send voting instructions by email instead of the post, the outcome is even better. However an electronic election still has a carbon footprint because electricity is required to power the servers that host your voting website, the computers used by voters, and the global networks that connect them. Much of that electricity is created from the burning of fossil fuels, like coal, oil and natural gas, all of which emit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. While many people may assume that websites have negligible carbon footprints, that is not the case. According to studies, the global carbon emissions due to information and communications technology are greater than those of the entire aviation industry. </p>
